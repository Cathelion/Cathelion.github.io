			<p> We provide a review of the proof of the gradient conjecture and compare different versions. Furthermore under more assumptions on

			<p> Here we will investigate the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation in its scalar and PDE form. In the former case, we will derive 
				conditions for spikes and periodic solutions. In the latter case, we will employ the software $\texttt{pde2path}$ to investigate 
			stability of pulse solutions and branch continuation.</p>

			<a href="/Obstacle_Project.pdf">Some Regularity Results for the Obstacle Problem</a>
			<p> Here we will treat some basic regularity results for the classical obstacle problem. Firstly regularity of the solution is established and 
			succinctly, with the help of blow-ups, regularity of the free boundary. Contrary to usual methods, we will not use any monotonicity formulas
				for the regularity, only homogeneity and convexity of blow-ups.</p>

        		<h3>Lund University - Bachelor thesis</h3>
          <a href="/bthesis.pdf">Optimality gaps and regularity for one-dimensional variational problems</a>
				<p> In this Bachelor thesis we will provide a light treatment to the topic of optimality 
					gaps and regularity for integral functionals. First we will establish the classical existence
					result by Tonelli, via the so called direct method. Proceedingly we discuss examples of gaps 
					between the infima over different classes of functions. We start with the classical Lavrentiev
					phenomenon (gap between $AC$ and $Lipschitz$) and continue with gaps involving $C^k$. 
					In the last section we will look at different regularity conditions, that is conditions 
					such that gaps between certain infima do not occur and end with some applications to ODE's.</p>
