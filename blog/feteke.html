			<h2>Fekete's Lemma</h2>
        Recently I have come across Fekete's Lemma, a useful tool in elementary analysis. <br> We used it to show that subexponential groups are amenable, but there are many different applications.
    	<br>
          <br>
          <h3> Lemma </h3>
      Let $a_n, n\in \mathbb{N}$ be a subadditive sequence of real numbers, i.e.
$a_{k+j}\leq a_k + a_j$ for any $k,j\in \mathbb{N}$. Then $ \lim_n \frac{a_n}{n}=\inf_n \frac{a_n}{n}$, where the infimum is possibly $-\infty$.
      <br>
         <br>
          Morally speaking, subadditivity means that the sequence $a_n$ can not grow too quickly, i.e. not superlinear. <br>
	Examples are the sequences $a_n= \sqrt{n}$ or $a_n\ln{n+1}$, for linear sequences $a_n =Cn$ equality holds. <br>
The sequence $a_n = n^2$ is obviously not subadditive, however $a_n=-n^2$ is.<br>
	One can easily imagine how playing around with the natural logarithm and the size of a subexponential group gives a subadditive sequence...
      <br>
      <br>
          <h3> Proof </h3>
      Set $L=\inf_n \frac{a_n}{n}$, which always exists. It remains to show that $\lim_n \frac{a_n}{n}=L$. 
          <br>
			<h4> Case 1:</h4>
			Suppose $L \neq -\infty$. Let $\varepsilon > 0$  and take $m\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\frac{a_m}{m} < L + \varepsilon $.<br>
	Now fix the constant $b:= \max_{i=1,...,m} a_i$ and consider $n\geq m$. <br>
	Write $n=mq+r$ for $q=q(n)=\lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor \in \mathbb{N}$ and $r=r(n)= n- \lfloor \frac{n}{m} \rfloor m < m$. <br>
	Then
\begin{equation*}
    a_n= a_{qm+r} = a_{m+...+m+r} \leq a_m + ... + a_m + a_r \leq q a_m + b,
\end{equation*}
where the subadditivity was used $q+1$ times in the first inequality and the upper bound $b$ in the second.<br>
Divide now by $n$,
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{a_n}{n} \leq \frac{q a_m +b}{n} < \frac{q (L+\varepsilon)m +b}{n} = \frac{q (L+\varepsilon)m}{n} + \frac{b}{n}. 
\end{equation*}
When passing to the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$, the second term $\frac{b}{n}$ converges to zero.<br>
Moreover, since $q = \lfloor \frac{n}{m} \rfloor$, $\frac{q m}{ n} = \frac{ \lfloor \frac{n}{m} \rfloor m}{n} \rightarrow 1$ and thus $\lim_n \frac{a_n}{n} \leq L + \varepsilon $. <br>
			Since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, the result follows. 

                                                   <br>
        <h4> Case 2:</h4> Suppose $L=-\infty$.  Let $M$ be arbitrary, then there exists $m$ such that $\frac{a_m}{m} < M$. <br>
			Again $b:= \max_{i=1,...,m} a_i$ and $n=mq+r$. <br>
			As above,
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{a_n}{n} \leq \frac{q a_m +b}{n} < \frac{q Mm +b}{n} = \frac{q Mm}{n} + \frac{b}{n},
\end{equation*}
so passing to the limit gives $\lim_n \frac{a_n}{n}\leq M$ and since $M$ can be taken arbitrarily small, $\lim_n \frac{a_n}{n} = -\infty $.
