      <h1>Florian Grün</h1>
      <p>From April 2024 I will be a PhD student in mathematics under supervision of Prof. Tatsuya Miura at Kyoto University in Japan. 
         Previously, I obtained a master in mathematics with a minor in CSE at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland and a BSc in mathematics at Lund University in Sweden.</p>

      <p>Within mathematics, I am interested in Analysis, Geometry and Optimization, especially when using geometric arguments to prove rigorous analytical results. In particular that means (partial) differential equations, calculus of variations, differential geometry and dynamical systems. 
         Currently, I am studying elastic curves and flows, in my master I was mainly interested in free boundary problems.  <br>
