      <h3>Florian Gruen </h3>
      <p>I am a PhD student in mathematics at <a href="https://www.math.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en">Kyoto University</a>, where I am advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tatsuya-miura">Tatsuya Miura</a>. 
         Previously, I obtained a MSc in mathematics from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/en/">EPFL</a>) in Switzerland and a BSc in mathematics from <a href="https://www.maths.lu.se/english/">Lund University</a> in Sweden.</p>

      <p>I am interested in Analysis, Geometry and Optimization, especially when using geometric arguments to prove rigorous analytical results. In particular that means (partial) differential equations, calculus of variations, geometric measure theory and numerical analysis. 
         Currently, I am studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastica_theory">elastic curves</a> and flows, during my master's I was mainly focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_boundary_problem">free boundary problems</a>. 
         See also <a href="research/research.html">here</a> for my current and previous work.
